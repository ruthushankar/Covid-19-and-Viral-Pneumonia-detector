# Covid-19-and-Viral-Pneumonia-detector
Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19 detector using chest X-rays. Employs resent-18. Detection is made by using PyTorch Library in python.
Libraries used : torch, numpy ,Pillow, matplotlib.
Image transformations are done using data augmentation.

1300 samples of x rays for each( Covid-19 and Viral Pneumonia)
Data augmentation and normalization for training set. Data Augmentation is performed to get many variations of the same dataset.(PyTorch)
Finally pretrained model called ResNet18 is used for model training.
